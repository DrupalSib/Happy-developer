Happy Developer Module

Happy Developer is a Feature [1] that enables a bunch of helper modules for use
during development. It uses Strongarm [2] to disable preprocessing of CSS and 
JS, disables caching, and enables other developer modules if they are available.
Upon disabling of Happy Developer module, it will clean up after itself, and
disable the developer modules as well.
